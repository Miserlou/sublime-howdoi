# Sublime Text 2 - howdoi

Forgot again how bash conditionals work? This plugin will tell you how! Just ask `howdoi> bash if statements`!

This plugin wraps Benjamin Gleitzman's glorious [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) script and makes
it available directly from sublime!


## Installation (IMPORTANT)

0. Install **howdoi**: `pip install howdoi`
1. Either clone this repo into your `Packages` directory, or install the _howdoi_ package
   from [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) (not available yet).
2. Set the `howdoi_path` in the `howdoi.sublime-settings` file (Preferences > Package Settings > howdoi).


## Usage

Hit `ctrl+shift+h` (use `command` instead of `ctrl` on OSX) and write your query in the prompt.


## Common Issues

None yet!
